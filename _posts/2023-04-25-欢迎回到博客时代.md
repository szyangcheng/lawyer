欢迎回到博客时代。

博客是一个提供更多深入思考的地方。

博客已经渐渐被人遗忘了，现在很多人可能都不知道，在抖音、小红书、知乎、微博之前，还有博客的存在，更不要说更“古早”一些的BBS了。

有一段时间，网上重大的事件，是通过博客爆出来的。那个时候，有许多博客平台，例如新浪博客、网易博客、博客大巴……有一大批非常有名的博主，例如韩寒、徐静蕾……他们在网络上发起话题，常常引来千万人讨论，那似乎是个百家争鸣的年代。

现在呢，所有人都拿着手机、竖着平板，看的是各平台的短视频。短视频都是什么样的内容呢？AI生成的声音，粗糙的剪辑，夸张的效果……看的时候可能会很爽，可是看过之后呢？短视频就像黑洞一样不断吸取人们的注意力和时间，却什么也没有留下。
>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way–in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only。
